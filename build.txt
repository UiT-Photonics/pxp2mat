# TODO: make this into a proper script
# NOTE:
# - python >= 3.11.4 doesn't works as of 2024-03-20 (nuitka 2.1.2), see
#   https://github.com/Nuitka/Nuitka/issues/2521
# - haven't tested with anything but micromamba. i assume mamba should work, no
#   no idea about conda

# change these as you like 
PKG_MNGR=micromamba
INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local/bin
ENV=pxpbuilder
PRJ=pxp2mat

# create an environment to build in
$PKG_MNGR create -y -n $ENV python=3.11.3
# install the necessary packages (with autoconfirm)
$PKG_MNGR install -y -n $ENV -c conda-forge nuitka ordered-set zstandard numpy scipy
# activate the environment
$PKG_MNGR activate $ENV
# install igor2 with pip since it's not in conda-forge
pip install igor2
# build the thing
python -m nuitka --standalone --onefile $PRJ.py

# TODO: check that it worked out

# remove the build files
rm -rf $PRJ.build $PRJ.dist $PRJ.onefile-build
# deactivate the environment..
$PKG_MNGR deactivate
# ..and remove it
$PKG_MNGR env remove -y -n $ENV

# this last step is very optional and not really recommended

# install the binary
sudo install -T $PRJ.bin $INSTALL_PREFIX/$PRJ
